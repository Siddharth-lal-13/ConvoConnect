## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

ConvoConnect implements a sophisticated client-server architecture optimized for real-time communication:

### Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) Architecture
For supporting 100+ participants efficiently, ConvoConnect uses the SFU approach:

- **Scalable Design**: Unlike mesh networking (which requires O(n¬≤) connections), SFU centralizes stream management where each participant sends one stream to the server, which then selectively forwards appropriate streams to recipients.
- **Performance Optimization**: SFU forwards raw streams without re-encoding (unlike MCU architecture), significantly reducing server CPU load and latency‚Äîcritical for large-scale real-time applications.
- **Adaptive Streaming**: Dynamically prioritizes active speakers and adjusts quality based on bandwidth availability.

### Implementation Note
The current implementation uses Agora's WebRTC API for video routing rather than a self-hosted SFU solution. This decision was made to ensure reliability without the infrastructure costs of deploying dedicated SFU servers. With sufficient server resources, the application can be migrated to a fully self-hosted SFU implementation like Janus or Mediasoup.
